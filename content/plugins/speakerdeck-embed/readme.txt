Add Speaker Deck presentations really easily. Just paste the speakerdeck.com URL on its own line in your post editor, like:

This plugin talks to Speaker Deck's oEmbed provider and transparently embeds your slideshow.

Or, use it via a shortcode if your prefer. These formats work:

	[speakerdeck http://speakerdeck.com/u/mattwiebe/p/power-your-portfolio-with-wordpress]
	[speakerdeck url="http://speakerdeck.com/u/mattwiebe/p/power-your-portfolio-with-wordpress"]

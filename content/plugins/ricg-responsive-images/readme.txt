Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

== Description ==

Bringing automatic default responsive images to WordPress.

This plugin works by including all available image sizes for each image upload. Whenever WordPress outputs the image through the media uploader, or whenever a featured image is generated, those sizes will be included in the image tag via the srcset attribute.

**Full documentation and contributor guidelines can be found on [Github](https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images)**

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you'd like to enable the advanced image compression feature, Please see the instructions at https://github.com/ResponsiveImagesCG/wp-tevko-responsive-images/tree/dev#advanced-image-compression

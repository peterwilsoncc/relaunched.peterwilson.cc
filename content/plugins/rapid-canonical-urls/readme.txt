Reduce 301 redirects and HTTP requests by using HTML5â€™s history API to
show visitors the correct, canonical URL.

== Description ==

WordPress uses 301 redirects to redirect URLs to their canonical version.

In cases where the non-canonical version will show the correct content,
it is possible to use the HTML5 history API to show visitors the correct
URL without the additional HTTP request.

This reduces HTTP requests, speeding up access for visitors and reducing
the load on your server.

It is *strongly recommended* you use this plugin in association with an
SEO plugin that adds canonical URL meta tags.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the rapid-canonical-urls folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the Rapid Canonical URLs plugin through WordPress's 'Plugins' menu
3. (Optional but recommended) If you haven't already, install an SEO plugin which adds canonical URL tags
